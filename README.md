# KMMNotes ðŸ“’

KMMNotes is a Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) application. This project is my journey to explore the capabilities of KMM and its potential for seamless interoperability. This project is a follow-through of a KMM course on YouTube by [Phillip Lackner](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilippLackner).
